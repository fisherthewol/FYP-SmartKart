\chapter{Project Background and Purpose}
\section{Objectives}
The usefulness of this project is the safety benefits it may provide. If the 
Artefact produced can reduce the frequency that a driver needs to check their 
speedometer, then they will be more aware of road conditions.

This project is motivated by the increasing deployment of average speed check zones 
throughout the UK, and the potential they have for causing distracted driving.

\subsection{Primary Objectives} \label{PrimaryObjectives}
The Primary Objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An app (for a smartphone) that determines when the user is in an 
average speed check zone, and begins tracking average speed.
    \item Said app then warns, with an audbile warning, if the average speed 
is above the limit.
    \item Voice commands may be used to launch the app on command (for 
example, if there is temporary speed check area).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
If time allows, the project may achieve the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app allows for the user to manually set what the speed limit is 
(for example if a road has a temporarily reduced speed limit).
    \item The app allows for setting the audbile warning to a custom sound.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tertiary Objectives}
In many territories globally, the use of devices and apps to detect speed 
cameras is explicitly or potentially illegal. It would be ideal 
if the app could detect this, and prevent its own usage.

\section{Scope}
There is scope within the project to provide an app that is cross 
platform, using technologies such as Flutter, UNO, and .NET MAUI (n√©e 
Xamarin.Forms). 
This would allow users of the two major mobile ecosystems to use the app. 
However, doing so may hamper the ability of the developer to write suffecient 
code in the time provided.
Hence, a cross-platform app is not included in the project at this time.

There is also scope to build an independent database of average speed check 
areas. 
This would be a significant undertaking, and there are already public datasets 
available for use. As such, making such a database is not 
in the scope of this project.
However, allowing for contribution to such datasets from within the app would 
serve the public good, and may well be within the scope of the project.

\section{Deliverables}
The Project will deliver an Android Application that meets the Primary 
Objectives (in section \ref{PrimaryObjectives}).

The project will have met its objectives when the app matches provides 
features defined by the Primary Objectives. It will exceed them if it 
\textbf{also} implements Secondary or Tertiary Objectives.

\section{Constraints}
%% Externally Imposed requirements.

\section{Assumptions}
%% If Unknown Elements, what assumptions made to account for these.
