\chapter{Project Background and Purpose}
\section{Objectives}
The usefulness of this project is the safety benefits it may provide. If the 
Artefact produced can reduce the frequency that a driver needs to check their 
speedometer, then they will be more aware of road conditions.

This project is motivated by the increasing deployment of average speed check 
zones throughout the UK, and the potential they have for leading to distracted 
driving.
% Source?? Can't find source on "increasing" deployment.

\subsection{Primary Objectives} \label{PrimaryObjectives}
The Primary Objectives of this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An app (for a smartphone) that determines when the user is in an 
average speed check zone, and begins tracking average speed.
    \item Said app then warns, with an audible warning, if the average speed 
is above the limit.
    \item Voice commands may be used to launch the app at the user's request 
(for example, if there is temporary speed check area).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Secondary Objectives}
If time allows, the project may achieve the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app allows for the user to manually set what the speed limit is 
(for example if a road has a temporarily reduced speed limit).
    \item The app allows for setting the audible warning to a custom sound.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Tertiary Objectives}
In many territories globally, the use of devices to detect speed cameras is 
illegal, and apps are either explicitly or potentially illegal. It would be 
ideal if the app could detect it was in such a territory, and prevent its own 
usage.

\section{Scope}
There is scope within the project to provide an app that is cross 
platform, using technologies such as Flutter, UNO, and .NET MAUI (née 
Xamarin.Forms)\footnote{Flutter (citation), UNO (Citation), .NET MAUI (Citation).}. 
This would allow users of the two major mobile ecosystems to use the app. 
However, doing so may hamper the ability of the developer to write sufficient 
code in the time provided.
Hence, a cross-platform app is not included in the project at this time.

There is also scope to build an independent database of average speed check 
areas. This would be a significant undertaking, and there are already public 
datasets available for use. As such, making such a database is not in the scope % source the datasets.
of this project. However, allowing for contribution to such datasets from 
within the app would serve the public good, and may well be within the scope of 
the project.

\section{Deliverables}
The Project will deliver an Android Application that meets the Primary 
Objectives (in section \ref{PrimaryObjectives}). The development will be 
demonstrating Agile Methodologies and Modern Internal Structuring.
%% Such as??

The project will have met its objectives when the app matches provides 
features defined by the Primary Objectives. It will exceed them if it 
\textbf{also} implements Secondary or Tertiary Objectives.

\section{Constraints}
Testing the application in the most \textit{straightforward} way may be 
constrained by applicable law, insurance, and ethics. Otherwise, there are no 
external constraints known at this time.

\section{Assumptions}
There are currently no unknowns for this project; hence, there are no 
assumptions to be made.

\section{Project Benefits}
%What benefits will a successful project bring, and to whom?  Note that this is about the project’s content and purpose, not the fact that you are doing a project for your degree.
\section{Project Operation}
%How will you operate the project?  Will you use a particular methodology for it and for any software development?  How will you measure the success of your choice?
\section{Options}
%What options are available to you for the tools, techniques and design parameters of your project?  How will you evaluate them and make the best selection?
\section{Risk Analysis}
%What risks might affect the outcome of your project or its stakeholders?  How severe are they, and what steps will you take to mitigate against them?
\section{Resources Required}
%What resources will you need for the project?  Are any non-standard?  Are they already available?  What effect will it have if they are not available or are delayed, and how would you manage that?
